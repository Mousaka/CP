Notes from Computational physics

interpreter: Translates language, You write in readable code, but the interpreter translates this for the machine to understand.

Pseudo code: fake, not real thing. Understandable code for humans but it's not really working.
Example:
	loop
		print welcome message
	end loop

But in fortran:
	DO I=1, 10
		WRITE(*,*) "welcome"
	END
